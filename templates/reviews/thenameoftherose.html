                    <p>The Name of the Rose by Umberto Eco is still fresh in my mind, 
                        as fresh as the sincere curiosity of Adso when he enters that 
                        diabolical monastery at the start of the story. Umberto takes
                        a seemingly alien, cryptic and far removed period of history 
                        and brings it to a supreme fullness of life that is both extremely
                        intelligent and erudite, and also comedically witty and satirical;
                        this combination is the formula for the success of this book, 
                        where an everyday reader can feel the connection to a 14th century 
                        Franscican monk who had studied with both Francis Bacon and William of Occam.
                        The pleasure in reading this book also lies in the stunningly beautiful writing
                        that Eco employs to describe the mediaeval way of life the Benedictine monks 
                        are living, in all the fantastic imagery, symbolism and philosophy of the Catholic
                        world of Western Europe at this time, as well as the gruesome, tyrannical and absurd
                        schisms and rents in the men of God. Reading this work, one feels both the sublimity 
                        and perversity of the monastic life.</p>
                <p> At its core, this novel is a murder mystery whose protagonist Adso, a German Benedictine monk
                     from Germany, plays Watson to his co-protagonist and mentor Brother William of Baskerville, an English Fransciscan,
                      is a Sherlock Holmes figure whose task it is to solve the abbot’s problem and discover the source of a series of murders
                       which have been taking place against the monks of this remote Italian monastery. Brother William utilises the philosophy 
                       of empiricism, scepticism and a form of proto-science to reach his conclusions, uncovering connections and clues through 
                       his sharp reasoning. These tools are what enabled him to be such an effective inquisitor in his day, and are what he uses throughout 
                       the novel, often to the confusion and consternation of poor young Adso of the faith. William is at at the core of one of the themes of 
                       the book, the light of Truth, logic and liberal thinking which is set against the Dark of obfuscation, confusion and absolutism; William
                        is often at odds with the ideology of the abbot and other monks of his time, who take a dogmatic approach to the faith and heresy. There 
                        is also another theme that William incarnated, that of realist, common sense connected to the world around him at odds with the trancedelist
                         naivete that the ecclesiastical echelons of the monastery, that is so disconnected from reality, that none of them can make an argument without
                          referring to scripture, and they don’t even even speak the ‘vulgar’ language of the surrounding settlements. A quote that sums up Brother Williams
                           character to me is as follows, seen through the eyes of Adso:</p>
                    <p><em>“And you”, I said with childish impertinence, “never commit errors?”
                        “Often,” he answered. “But instead of conceiving only one, I imagine many, so I become the slave of none”.
