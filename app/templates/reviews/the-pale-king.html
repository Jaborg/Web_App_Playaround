                <p>Writing a book review on an unfinished, posthumously published, and disjointed novel has proven to be a tough endeavour; David Foster Wallace’s The Pale King is his final work, and it still stands amongst his best fiction. Ostensibly about the Regional Examinations Centre of Peoria for the Internal Revenue Service, the themes revolve around the bureaucratic, behemothic nature of the IRS, and the machinations of the people who work and live their lives within it, under the extreme tedium of the work itself. The boringness of the average examiners job is a key theme within this novel, as Wallace dissects the behaviours and personalities that inhabit the extreme edges of monotony and drudgery. The idiosyncrasies, thoughts and backgrounds to all these characters are extremely well developed and nuanced, offering classic DFW insights and perspectives that are unique to his writing and character.</p>

                    David Foster Wallace’s choice of the IRS as the foreground for his next major novel after Infinite Jest is interesting to consider, and highlights what I think are some of the major ideas he wants to explore within this work. As mentioned frequently within the novel itself, the IRS does not conjure to the average American’s mind anything seen as especially fascinating, valorous, courageous, or in any way remarkable enough to stand out as an inspiring career path or calling. In fact, what it does evoke is dullness and feelings of a living death trapped within the bureaucratic machine, completing rote work day in and day out. DFW, having worked there himself and after conducting a large amount of research into the institution for this book, does not dispute that these are what are represented in the IRS; what he does do is turns the perception of these seemingly low merit values in on themselves, and states that the capacity of these tax workers to choose this unsung career, to suffer under the yolk of extreme boredom and tediousness, to bare the necessity of the absolutely monotonous work being done is what makes them the real ‘heroes’. Although there is no dazzle and no space for simple, clear heroics, the essential nature of the IRS as the blood of the American way of life and government makes these IRS workers in a way heroic. This theme of inglourious work, boredom and consistency closely relate to DFW’s ideas surrounding pleasure, meaning and what it means to be a modern American; he sees these values as represented by the IRS in this novel as neglected ideals, supplanted by easy, instant gratification and longing for some obvious, popular significance. The Pale King, in classic Wallacian wit, demonstrates this throughout its fractured narrative. </p>
                <p>Just what boredom is and what exactly human beings go through to endure it are discussed at length (not boringly so) in this novel. Personally I have never much thought about the topic of boredom itself, except for when I try to escape my own; for self evident reasons it is not a popular subject to talk about and certainly is avoided in most mainstream discussion, except in a humourful, ironic way on how to avoid it. In fact, one of the major discussions DFW’s books bring to the table is that much of today’s society is designed to keep boredom, in any shape or form for any duration of time, at arm’s length; he sees that people have some kind of existential dread when faced with the clarity that monotonous action or lack of stimulation brings to one’s self, a dread that is covered and dulled by avoiding the perils of tedium through loud, instantaneous and gaudy distractions. In a highly entertaining way Wallace in The Pale King takes the reader through his own thoughts and opinions on the nature of the mundane, which blends well into his broader tapestry of works and ideals on modern (Mostly Western) society. </p>

                <p>	The writing of David Foster Wallace is iconic, it speaks to you in a highly analytical, self-aware and deprecating, humourful manner, and brings startlingly clear and unique insights to the reader. The Pale King, the last of his works, is no exception to his idiosyncratic style. The novel is filled with incredibly detailed, nuanced and intelligent descriptions of seemingly ordinary scenes and interactions, which are difficult to read at times, which push you and make the reader work to understand exactly what is being portrayed. The work you put into this comprehension pays off as an incredibly entertaining read and an utterly distinctive perspective on the world that you will only find in the works of DFW. His telltale footnotes, remarkably long sentences, combined with his penchant for acronyms and the minutiae of a scene and its background bring to mind his similar style in Infinite Jest. I once read about Wallace that a lot of his scenes work in a state of stasis, where the action is secondary to the vivid worldbuilding and background that he creates. The characters are also in a similar vein, entirely unique and diverse and entertaining.</p>

                <p> Although this novel was unfortunately never finished, leading to a fractured storyline with no conclusion or overall cohesion (similar to this review) David Foster Wallace’s brilliance can still be found shining throughout. The intimacy of this work was breathtaking and well worth the effort. It makes you feel like the author is a close friend of yours who is taking you on a consummately constructed story, full of biting humour, an exhaustive array of insights, and a fascinating glimpse into the mundane bureaucracy of the IRS.</p>
