                <p>I bought this book after watching the famous debates on Youtube of Foucault vs Chomsky, which I found to be extremely entertaining to listen to (Also impressive was their ability to converse on complex subjects in entirely different languages to each other). Their discussion centered around the concepts of power in society and how to transcend or fight within the system in order to alter it for the better; in order to do so one had to recognise the institutions, the norms and the techniques utilized to wield and distribute power. It was only afterwards that I found out that both interlocutors were self professed anarchists. The difference between them lay in the fact that Chomsky believed that there was a higher ideal defined which we could aspire towards in order to reach a more just world; Foucault ,on the other hand, proposed that all our concepts of justice, peace and equality have been created within the apparatus of control which we have all spent our lives within. He says there can be no ideal as we have been indoctrinated in the society that we live in. His ideas were like nothing I had heard before and I was intrigued; researching which of his works was the most accessible to an ordinary civilian like myself, I found Discipline and Punish.</p>
                
                <p>At the outset I believed this would be a clear cut history of prison and the disciplinary techniques and punishments that lay intrinsically within it; however, this book proved to be as philosophical as I should have realized. Although it started within an overview of punishment at the beginning of the 15th century, centering around a public spectacle of punishment towards the criminal to reassert the ultimate power of the sovereign through an almost extreme overreaction of violence, it carried forward into the mechanisms of discipline that were beginning to form and coalesce throughout society as a whole. The detailed interrogation of what Discipline is and how it contributed to the large transformation of how institutions of power function was unexpectedly brilliant and definitely the crowning part of interest for me in the book. The most over example of this that he provided was through the reorganization of the military for maximum efficiency. Let me not get ahead of myself. What is discipline? Foucault describes it as the mastering of optimisation when administering a multiplicity of subjects; the point at which the weight of numbers is overcome by the productivity that one can extract from the body you are working with, be that soldiers, patients, schoolchildren, industrial workers or prisoners. </p>

                <p>He describes this new discipline as having its basis in the measurement of time and the individual classification and specificity of each individual person with the multiplicity. On the measurement of time he mentions timetables, proscribed activities following a rigorous schedule and the optimisation of what a productive worker should be doing to maximize his efficiency. Although a brief summary of his highly in depth analysis this is one of the major contributing factors in controlling the chaos of a highly populated system. On the individual measurement of each element within your control; Focualt talks in depth on these analyses of people that one could judge against this new idea of the Norm, a fixed point of value into which everyone within the, let's say a military squadron, could be judged against. This judgment provided a point of reference into how efficient an individual was performing, whether he needed to improve from below the Norm, or if he could progress into more advanced areas. One of the pivotal ideas that he draws upon to discuss this topic is the total surveillance of the Panopticon, a concept proposed by Jermey Bentham. In this panoptic concept FOucalt sees the apotheosis of the idea of discipline in modern society, one of a complete individualisation of a person, his vertical relationship with the wardens of power, constant and complete surveillance of his persona and productivity and the ability for these wardens to consistently measure, assess and classify each individual within the machine. The book goes on to discuss this in the formation of the prison system and the new justice system, going into a lot more depth than I have, but a book review is not supposed to just be a summary, am I right kids?</p>


                <p>On the language and style of the book; Discipline and Punish is not the most readable book in the world, it is a philosophical work from an extremely intelligent man. If I did not concentrate on everything that I was reading I found myself very quickly lost and confused in my wanderings, and would have to retread my steps to find my way. Having said that, Focualt does manage to keep your interest through his erudite study and extremely unique perspectives on the structures of power throughout society. I recommend giving it a go, and if you find the language too far removed from your interest you can always stop duh. </p>
